It became a mirror of how I live, think, and grow. But what does that really mean? Read about how I realized UX was always part of my life long before I had ever heard the term "UX".',content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">I only learned the word <em>UX</em> about two years ago. At the time, I was teaching myself web design and kept seeing it pop up. I looked into it, but I figured I’d stay focused on design itself since that seemed like the path I’d take. But everything changed during my last job at a major university in my city. I walked into a system that was completely disorganized. I was honestly shocked that such a prestigious university operated with so little structure, at least in our department. It threw me off. So I started fixing it.</p>

   <p class="mb-2">I built an organized project management system in Notion. I created a single source of truth for our department’s events. I reworked our entire marketing system with release timelines, narrative-driven fliers, and branding aligned with university's visual identity. I rebuilt our email newsletter from the ground up, with better UX, hierarchy, skimmability and tied everything into tracking and analytics. What started as just “fixing stuff” turned into something much bigger.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s when UX <em>clicked</em> for me. And it just so happened that I was also taking the <em>Google UX Design course on Coursera</em> at the same time. As I went deeper into UX thinking, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, I had a realization: This wasn’t just a design process. This was my <strong>life</strong>. I’ve failed a lot. I’d hit walls, take a step back, figure out what went wrong, try something new, and do it again. That is UX. That’s the mindset.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Take this example:</strong> When I was living in Japan, I entered a speech contest. I thought I was confident and even wore a suit to project that confidence. But the moment I got on stage, I froze. It was one of the hardest, most embarrassing moments of my life. But I didn’t quit. The next semester, I enrolled in a public speaking class. It turned out to be one of the most transformative experiences I’ve ever had. I was forced to speak in front of people <em>every single day</em>. Fast forward a few years, and I’m confidently teaching English to classrooms of 5 to 30 students. No nerves. No fear. That’s UX in real life.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">To be completely honest with you, I didn’t even graduate high school. I somehow managed to get my G.E.D. I was lost back then. No drive, no discipline, no goals. If that version of me could see who I am today, I don’t think he’d believe it. But maybe he should. Because everything I’ve become, the way I live, the way I think, the way I grow , it all ties back to the principles behind UX.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s why I believe I’ll thrive in this field. UX just <em>makes sense</em> to me. It’s how I approach everything: with empathy, structure, intention, and the understanding that iteration is the only path to growth. I know it won’t be easy. But honestly, I’m looking forward to that. Because if it’s hard, it means I’m learning.</p>

    <p>And iterating and learning is what I’ve always done best even when no one expected it from me.</p>
