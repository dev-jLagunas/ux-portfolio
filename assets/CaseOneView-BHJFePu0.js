To reduce friction and make the experience inclusive, we introduced a language toggle supporting English, Japanese, and Spanish. This directly reflects the empathy work we did early on, understanding our user base and designing with accessibility and cultural inclusivity in mind."},{title:"Responsive Design",image:J,heading:"Seamless Experience on Any Device",description:"The original site was hard to read on mobile and looked clunky on larger screens. By designing mobile-first and leveraging Tailwind CSS breakpoints, we ensured the new site adapts beautifully across devices. This aligns with our ideation and prototyping phase goals which were to prioritize clarity, comfort, and usability in every context."},{title:"Interactive Menu",image:q,heading:"Filterable & Image-Based Menu",description:"We replaced the static PDF menu with a fully interactive layout that lets users filter by food, drinks, or dessert. This improves skimmability and reinforces the playful tone of our brand. It was inspired by direct customer pain points and validated through informal testing and visual consistency analysis during the define phase."}],d=[{title:"One-Touch Contact",image:O,heading:"Instant Call & Map Buttons",description:"Users can now call us or get directions with a single tap. This wasn’t possible on our old site and created unnecessary barriers. Adding these touch-friendly elements addressed real-world needs uncovered during user journey mapping, particularly around mobile use and last-minute decision-making."},{title:"Visual Identity",image:X,heading:"Bold, Human-Centered Design",description:"Rather than copy the minimalist cafe style common in Japan, we leaned into color, culture, and personality. From the hero images to iconography, every visual reinforces who we are. This was a direct result of ideating around how to reflect our brand’s emotional tone digitally. This was something we knew was missing before."},{title:"Accessibility First",image:P,heading:" Designed with Clarity in Mind",description:"Accessibility wasn’t an afterthought. It was baked into the code and the visuals. We used semantic HTML, optimized contrast, and minimized cognitive load across pages. This decision grew out of our reflection phase, where we evaluated how even unintentional design choices can exclude users and then did our best  to correct that."}],u=[{title:"Brand & Space Alignment",description:'Multiple users commented that the site "felt like us". Which felt like a reflection of our cafe’s cultural warmth, vibrant personality, and inclusive vibe. This alignment wasn’t accidental; it was the result of dozens of thoughtful design decisions that translated our physical identity into digital form.'},{title:"Improved Usability",description:"Visitors or friends and family we asked to test our site consistently remarked on how intuitive. The information architecture, simplified navigation, and one-touch contact buttons all contributed to a smoother user flow. This was especially important for mobile-first users discovering us on the go."},{title:"Competitive Distinction",description:"In contrast to other local cafés, our site stood out for its polish, interactivity, and accessibility. This differentiation didn’t just boost credibility, it sparked genuine curiosity. And often lead to new customer visits. It was a quiet, UX-led marketing tool. Also, it was just another way to express our brand."},{title:"Organic Promotion",description:'Because the site was multilingual, beautifully branded and easy to use. Some visitors said they forwarded it to friends or family. A very common word thrown around was "kawaii" which translates to "cute". Without paid ads or SEO strategy, the site began organically spreading. We believe this a direct outcome of designing something people felt worthy of at least sharing.'}],h=[v,k,x,I],m=[{title:"Instinct is valuable, but process sharpens it.",icon:o,description:"When I first built this site, I relied entirely on intuition.
