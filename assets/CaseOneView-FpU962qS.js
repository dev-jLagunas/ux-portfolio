That’s when I set a personal challenge: teach myself web development and rebuild our entire cafe website from scratch, without templates or shortcuts","Over seven months, I studied every morning before opening shop, eventually launching a fully custom-coded site built with Angular and Tailwind CSS. It was responsive, multilingual, and deeply personal. Designed not just to function, but to feel like an extension of who we were.
