It became a mirror of how I live, think, and grow. But what does that really mean? Read about how I realized UX was always part of my life long before I had ever heard the term "UX".',content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">I only learned the word <em>UX</em> about two years ago. At the time, I was teaching myself web design and kept seeing it pop up. I looked into it, but I figured I’d stay focused on design itself since that seemed like the path I’d take. But everything changed during my last job at a major university in my city. I walked into a system that was completely disorganized. I was honestly shocked that such a prestigious university operated with so little structure, at least in our department. It threw me off. So I started fixing it.</p>

   <p class="mb-2">I built an organized project management system in Notion. I created a single source of truth for our department’s events. I reworked our entire marketing system with release timelines, narrative-driven fliers, and branding aligned with university's visual identity. I rebuilt our email newsletter from the ground up, with better UX, hierarchy, skimmability and tied everything into tracking and analytics. What started as just “fixing stuff” turned into something much bigger.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s when UX <em>clicked</em> for me. And it just so happened that I was also taking the <em>Google UX Design course on Coursera</em> at the same time. As I went deeper into UX thinking, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, I had a realization: This wasn’t just a design process. This was my <strong>life</strong>. I’ve failed a lot. I’d hit walls, take a step back, figure out what went wrong, try something new, and do it again. That is UX. That’s the mindset.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Take this example:</strong> When I was living in Japan, I entered a speech contest. I thought I was confident and even wore a suit to project that confidence. But the moment I got on stage, I froze. It was one of the hardest, most embarrassing moments of my life. But I didn’t quit. The next semester, I enrolled in a public speaking class. It turned out to be one of the most transformative experiences I’ve ever had. I was forced to speak in front of people <em>every single day</em>. Fast forward a few years, and I’m confidently teaching English to classrooms of 5 to 30 students. No nerves. No fear. That’s UX in real life.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">To be completely honest with you, I didn’t even graduate high school. I somehow managed to get my G.E.D. I was lost back then. No drive, no discipline, no goals. If that version of me could see who I am today, I don’t think he’d believe it. But maybe he should. Because everything I’ve become, the way I live, the way I think, the way I grow , it all ties back to the principles behind UX.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s why I believe I’ll thrive in this field. UX just <em>makes sense</em> to me. It’s how I approach everything: with empathy, structure, intention, and the understanding that iteration is the only path to growth. I know it won’t be easy. But honestly, I’m looking forward to that. Because if it’s hard, it means I’m learning.</p>

    <p>And iterating and learning is what I’ve always done best even when no one expected it from me.</p>

From user research to wireframes to final code, here’s what I learned and why it made me feel like a real designer for the first time.",content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">Before Bean And Beast, I had done UX work, even user research, but it was never this official. I’d talk to users, observe behaviors, and make mental notes, but it was all intuitive and informal. <strong>This time, I created a research plan. I asked targeted questions. I took real notes and gathered qualitative data I could analyze.</strong> That data shaped the project in ways I hadn’t experienced before. It gave me confidence that my designs were rooted in real user needs, not just assumptions.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">The other major shift was starting with low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes instead of jumping straight into code. I used to build directly in the browser, making changes on the fly, which always felt a bit clunky. But this time, I began with paper sketches, then Figma wireframes, then hi-fi mockups. And everything flowed so naturally. It was easier to see usability gaps, smoother to iterate, and far less refactoring was needed later on. The process itself improved the product.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Following the design thinking framework didn’t just make the case study better.</strong> It made <em>me</em> better. I internalized the phases. I became more methodical. I started seeing how structure leads to creativity, not away from it. Empathizing and defining gave my ideas focus. Ideation gave them shape. Prototyping and building gave them life. And all of it was grounded in purpose.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">I think the ideate and prototype phases had the biggest impact. For the first time, I took ideas from Crazy 8s sketches to digital wireframes, and I realized how much that middle space matters. You find the gaps. You get better ideas. And you stop wasting time coding things that don’t belong. That shift alone made the whole experience feel more professional.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">What I’m most proud of is that I did the entire thing myself. The branding, the characters, the research, the design, and even the code. I strongly believe I made something that looks and feels like a real startup.<strong>People I showed it to thought it was a live brand. One friend said, “I want to buy a set right now.”</strong>  That’s the kind of feedback that hits different.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Biggest headace?</strong> Definitely Figma wireframes. I overdid it. I designed way too many screens before realizing I only needed a focused set for testing. Still, it helped me improve fast. Even more I learned the importance of having the proper tools. In this case the proper hardware. I had to buy a more ergonomic mouse after those 14-hour Figma marathons!</p>

    <p class="mb-2">If I were to keep improving the project, I’d focus on usability testing. I haven’t done much of it yet, and it’s hard to get meaningful feedback on something that isn’t a real product. But once I land a UX job, that’s one area I’m excited to grow in. I’d also add small touches like local storage or flavor filters just to push the realism further.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">Most importantly, this project proved to me that I’m not just learning UX. I <strong>am</strong> a UX designer. I finally see how all my experiences, all my instincts, and now all this structure are coming together. The imposter syndrome is still there, but it’s getting quieter. And I know that this is just the beginning.</p>

This post explores six of the most widely used frameworks, explains how they work, and helps you decide which one to use based on your project goals.",content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">In UX design, a framework is a structured approach for turning an idea into a usable, user-centered product. Think of it as a roadmap: it doesn’t tell you exactly what turns to take, but it gives you the proven route options that help you avoid dead ends. I have found that the more structure to use as a guide, the smoothly the entire process goes. Frameworks provide a common language for teams, improve efficiency, and ensure a project remains focused on solving real user problems. They’re not rigid rules but flexible guides, adaptable to the needs, scope, and constraints of each project. I just recently made it a point to dive deep into the different frameworks that exist. Here are 6 that I found interesting.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-sect-title">1. Design Thinking</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-1">A human-centered, iterative problem-solving process.</h3>
    <ul class="mb-2">
      <li>~ Built around five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.</li>
      <li>~ Encourages deep user research before jumping into solutions.</li>
      <li>~ Iterative—teams can loop back to earlier phases as insights evolve.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>When to use:</strong> Best for projects where the problem space is unclear or requires deep understanding of user needs. For example, redesigning a public transportation app where you need to learn why riders are frustrated before proposing features. The iterative cycles let you refine solutions as you uncover more about your audience.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-sect-title">2. Double Diamond</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-1">A visual process model that alternates between divergent and convergent thinking.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>~ Four stages: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.</li>
      <li>~ "Diamond" phases represent broad exploration followed by focused decision-making.</li>
      <li>~ Balances creativity with structured evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-2"><strong>When to use:</strong> Ideal for teams that need a clear, visual roadmap to manage both exploration and refinement. For instance, creating a new e-commerce checkout flow, starting with wide-ranging research, then narrowing to tested, high-impact solutions.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-sect-title">3. Lean UX</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-1">A rapid, collaborative approach that prioritizes outcomes over deliverables.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>~ Integrates design, development, and business perspectives early.</li>
      <li>~ Uses quick experiments to validate ideas before heavy investment.</li>
      <li>~ Encourages a “build-measure-learn” feedback loop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-2"><strong>When to use:</strong> Great for fast-paced environments like startups or Agile teams, where speed and adaptability are essential. If you’re adding a new social feature to an existing platform, Lean UX lets you launch a minimal version quickly, measure engagement, and adjust without wasting months on full builds.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-sect-title">4. User-Centered Design (UCD)</h2>
    <h3 class"mb-1">A process that puts the user’s needs, wants, and limitations at the core of design decisions.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>~ Involves users throughout all design phases.</li>
      <li>~ Balances business goals with human factors.</li>
      <li>~ Relies on usability testing to guide iteration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-2"><strong>When to use:</strong> Perfect when accessibility and usability are critical, such as designing an online banking portal where mistakes have serious consequences. UCD ensures the product works for all intended users, including those with varying technical abilities.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-sect-title">5. Hook Model</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-1">A behavior-design framework for building habit-forming products.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>~ Four stages: Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment.</li>
      <li>~ Focuses on understanding psychological motivators.</li>
      <li>~ Effective for driving long-term user engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-2"><strong>When to use:</strong> Best when designing products that rely on frequent user interaction, like a language-learning app. By creating rewarding feedback loops, you encourage repeat usage and habit formation over time.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-sect-title">6. UX Honeycomb</h2>
    <h3 class="mb-1">A visual guide to the qualities of a good user experience.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>~ Seven facets: Useful, Usable, Desirable, Findable, Accessible, Credible, Valuable.</li>
      <li>~ Provides a quick checklist for evaluating designs.</li>
      <li>~ Helps prioritize improvements based on UX quality dimensions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-2"><strong>When to use:</strong> Useful as a diagnostic tool mid-project or during redesigns. For example, if a government services website has low adoption rates, running its design through the Honeycomb can pinpoint whether the issue is usability, findability, or credibility.</p>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">UX design frameworks aren’t about restricting creativity.They’re actually about channeling it effectively. The right framework provides structure, keeps teams aligned, and helps ensure your solutions are both user-friendly and business-viable. Whether you’re crafting a product from scratch or refining an existing one, understanding when and how to apply these frameworks can turn good ideas into exceptional experiences.</p>

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">When I first went through the <em>Google UX Designer Course</em> on Coursera, one of the biggest takeaways for me was how structured and cyclical the UX process can be. Even though I had studied frameworks before, the course tied it together in a way that made sense. But I still found myself wanting a single visual I could reference, something that mapped out the <strong>general flow</strong> of the UX framework from start to finish.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s why I created this custom flowchart. It’s directly inspired by the Google UX Designer course, but organized in my own way so I can quickly see the big picture at a glance. It follows a typical user-centered process, from identifying a problem to launching an MVP, and it also accounts for iteration. It shows when to loop back if issues arise during usability testing.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">The flow is read from top to bottom, with diamond shapes indicating decision points and arrows showing possible paths forward or back. The boxes contain the key activities in each step of the process, such as empathizing with users, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. The right-hand side shows logical loops — for example, going back to earlier research phases if the problem wasn’t clearly defined.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">On the left side of the diagram, I’ve also included <strong>possible artifacts or assets</strong> that could be produced in each stage. These serve as quick reminders of the tangible outputs you might create along the way, from empathy maps and POV statements to high-fidelity prototypes and usability test plans. I find this especially useful for planning projects or keeping track of deliverables when working in a team.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">This isn’t meant to be a rigid rulebook. Every project is different. But having a visual like this helps me remember the core flow and ensures I don’t skip critical steps in the UX process. It’s a tool for my own work, but I think it can also be helpful for other designers who want a clear, high-level map of the journey from idea to implementation.</p>

From navigation and layout to case study storytelling, I intentionally designed features that make the experience smooth, accessible, and even fun. Here’s a breakdown of the UX features I built into my portfolio and why they matter.",content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">When I designed my portfolio, I approached it as more than a showcase. I treated it as a user experience challenge: how could I make the act of <em>navigating my work</em> enjoyable, clear, and useful? Below, I’ll walk through the UX features I built into my site and explain why they matter.</p>

    <h2 class="font-bold">Navigation & Access</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">Navigation is the backbone of any site. I built mine with a responsive navbar and sidebar, making sure both desktop and mobile users get a clear, consistent way to move around. Each menu item has an icon <em>and</em> a label, improving both clarity and accessibility. Quick access buttons for “Contact” and a light/dark mode toggle are always visible, no matter where you are.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Inside my case studies, I added a reusable sticky navbar that highlights the current section and scrolls instantly to any part of the page. A back-to-top button is always present too, small and subtle until hovered, where it expands for easy interaction. Even loading states got attention. A clean spinner with playful captions like “working on it” or “thanks for waiting!” adds guidance and delight when pages switch.</p>
   <p><strong>Why it’s good UX:</strong> These navigation choices align with multiple usability heuristics. The persistent navbar and sidebar give users <em>visibility of system status</em> and <em>user control</em>, so they always know where they are and how to move. Icons paired with text improve <em>recognition rather than recall</em>, since users don’t have to guess what each option means. The sticky navbar and back-to-top button increase <em>efficiency of use</em>, reducing scrolling effort in long case studies. Even the loading spinner with captions addresses <em>visibility of system status</em> by giving clear feedback that the system is working while adding a touch of personality to keep the experience engaging.</p>


    <img src=${y} alt="Navigation and access UX features screenshot" class="my-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

    <h2 class="font-bold">Hero & Layout</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">At the top of my home page, I made sure the essentials stand out. Keywords like “UX / UI Designer” and “meaningful experiences” are styled in distinct colors, so someone scanning quickly can instantly pick up who I am and what I do. My hero section also has three key buttons: “Contact Me” opens a modal instantly, “Resume” downloads a PDF right away, and “See Work” scrolls directly to my case studies.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">The entire site is fully responsive, with grids and layouts adapting smoothly across devices. This isn’t flashy, but it’s foundational. recruiters and hiring managers often check portfolios on phones or tablets, and a broken layout can cost attention fast.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it’s good UX:</strong> The highlighted keywords in my hero section follow the heuristic of <em>aesthetic and minimalist design</em>, surfacing only the most important information so users can grasp my role at a glance. Quick-access buttons respect <em>efficiency of use</em> by connecting users directly to top goals such as contacting me, downloading a resume, or jumping to case studies. The responsive grid layout addresses <em>flexibility and efficiency</em>, ensuring the site works across devices and contexts. Together, these features create a first impression that is clear, efficient, and visually aligned with user expectations.</p>

    <img src=${b} alt="Hero section and layout UX features screenshot" class="my-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

    <h2 class="font-bold">Case Study Experience</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">My case studies aren’t just static pages. I tried to create a story and a guided experience. At the top, users can download a full PDF or view the live site version. Each case study is labeled with UX tags that preview the methods used, so readers know what to expect right away.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">I present visual artifacts (like empathy maps, personas, and journey maps) in auto-scrolling slides. Each one comes with a short blurb that ties back to the design thinking framework, helping users connect the dots between research and solutions. Solution content is chunked into tabbed sections, each with visuals and narrative, so readers can digest the story step by step. A sticky navbar guides navigation within the study, and a back-to-case-studies button makes exiting easy.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s good UX:</strong> My case studies are designed with heuristics like <em>consistency and standards</em> and <em>recognition rather than recall</em> in mind. Downloadable PDFs and links to live sites provide <em>flexibility</em> so users can choose their preferred format. UX tags at the top give <em>visibility</em> into what the study covers. Auto-scrolling visual artifacts paired with short blurbs help chunk information into <em>recognizable</em>, digestible units rather than relying on users to recall details. Tabbed solution sections demonstrate <em>aesthetic and minimalist design</em> by avoiding overwhelming walls of content. Finally, the sticky navbar and back button reinforce <em>user control and freedom</em>, allowing readers to navigate or exit easily at any point.</p>

    <img src=${v} alt="Case study UX features screenshot" class="my-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

    <h2 class="font-bold">Branding & Trust</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">Lastly, I designed a custom name logo to build a recognizable personal brand. It’s not just decoration. I would hope it signals identity and professionalism. Consistent branding helps build trust, which is crucial in a portfolio context where first impressions matter a lot.</p>
   <p><strong>Why it’s good UX:</strong> My custom logo supports <em>consistency and standards</em> by giving a recognizable visual anchor across my portfolio. It also contributes to <em>aesthetic and minimalist design</em>, keeping branding clean and professional without excess. Strong branding builds trust and credibility, aligning with the heuristic of <em>match between system and real world</em>: just as products use branding to signal reliability, a designer’s portfolio benefits from recognizable identity that sets expectations and reassures users they’re in the right place.</p>

    <img src=${k} alt="Custom logo branding screenshot" class="my-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg h-56" />

    <p class="blog-paragraphs">Taken together, these features show that my portfolio itself is a UX project. Every decision, from navigation to case study storytelling, was made with the user in mind. Because if I can’t design a usable, engaging experience for my own portfolio, how could I do it for someone else’s product?</p>
