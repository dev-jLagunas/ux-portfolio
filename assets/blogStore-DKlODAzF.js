It became a mirror of how I live, think, and grow. But what does that really mean? Read about how I realized UX was always part of my life long before I had ever heard the term "UX".',content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">I only learned the word <em>UX</em> about two years ago. At the time, I was teaching myself web design and kept seeing it pop up. I looked into it, but I figured I’d stay focused on design itself since that seemed like the path I’d take. But everything changed during my last job at a major university in my city. I walked into a system that was completely disorganized. I was honestly shocked that such a prestigious university operated with so little structure, at least in our department. It threw me off. So I started fixing it.</p>

   <p class="mb-2">I built an organized project management system in Notion. I created a single source of truth for our department’s events. I reworked our entire marketing system with release timelines, narrative-driven fliers, and branding aligned with university's visual identity. I rebuilt our email newsletter from the ground up, with better UX, hierarchy, skimmability and tied everything into tracking and analytics. What started as just “fixing stuff” turned into something much bigger.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s when UX <em>clicked</em> for me. And it just so happened that I was also taking the <em>Google UX Design course on Coursera</em> at the same time. As I went deeper into UX thinking, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, I had a realization: This wasn’t just a design process. This was my <strong>life</strong>. I’ve failed a lot. I’d hit walls, take a step back, figure out what went wrong, try something new, and do it again. That is UX. That’s the mindset.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Take this example:</strong> When I was living in Japan, I entered a speech contest. I thought I was confident and even wore a suit to project that confidence. But the moment I got on stage, I froze. It was one of the hardest, most embarrassing moments of my life. But I didn’t quit. The next semester, I enrolled in a public speaking class. It turned out to be one of the most transformative experiences I’ve ever had. I was forced to speak in front of people <em>every single day</em>. Fast forward a few years, and I’m confidently teaching English to classrooms of 5 to 30 students. No nerves. No fear. That’s UX in real life.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">To be completely honest with you, I didn’t even graduate high school. I somehow managed to get my G.E.D. I was lost back then. No drive, no discipline, no goals. If that version of me could see who I am today, I don’t think he’d believe it. But maybe he should. Because everything I’ve become, the way I live, the way I think, the way I grow , it all ties back to the principles behind UX.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">That’s why I believe I’ll thrive in this field. UX just <em>makes sense</em> to me. It’s how I approach everything: with empathy, structure, intention, and the understanding that iteration is the only path to growth. I know it won’t be easy. But honestly, I’m looking forward to that. Because if it’s hard, it means I’m learning.</p>

    <p>And iterating and learning is what I’ve always done best even when no one expected it from me.</p>

From user research to wireframes to final code, here’s what I learned and why it made me feel like a real designer for the first time.",content:`
    <p class="blog-paragraphs">Before Bean And Beast, I had done UX work, even user research, but it was never this official. I’d talk to users, observe behaviors, and make mental notes, but it was all intuitive and informal. <strong>This time, I created a research plan. I asked targeted questions. I took real notes and gathered qualitative data I could analyze.</strong> That data shaped the project in ways I hadn’t experienced before. It gave me confidence that my designs were rooted in real user needs, not just assumptions.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">The other major shift was starting with low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes instead of jumping straight into code. I used to build directly in the browser, making changes on the fly, which always felt a bit clunky. But this time, I began with paper sketches, then Figma wireframes, then hi-fi mockups. And everything flowed so naturally. It was easier to see usability gaps, smoother to iterate, and far less refactoring was needed later on. The process itself improved the product.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Following the design thinking framework didn’t just make the case study better.</strong> It made <em>me</em> better. I internalized the phases. I became more methodical. I started seeing how structure leads to creativity, not away from it. Empathizing and defining gave my ideas focus. Ideation gave them shape. Prototyping and building gave them life. And all of it was grounded in purpose.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">I think the ideate and prototype phases had the biggest impact. For the first time, I took ideas from Crazy 8s sketches to digital wireframes, and I realized how much that middle space matters. You find the gaps. You get better ideas. And you stop wasting time coding things that don’t belong. That shift alone made the whole experience feel more professional.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">What I’m most proud of is that I did the entire thing myself. The branding, the characters, the research, the design, and even the code. I strongly believe I made something that looks and feels like a real startup.<strong>People I showed it to thought it was a live brand. One friend said, “I want to buy a set right now.”</strong>  That’s the kind of feedback that hits different.</p>

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Biggest headace?</strong> Definitely Figma wireframes. I overdid it. I designed way too many screens before realizing I only needed a focused set for testing. Still, it helped me improve fast. Even more I learned the importance of having the proper tools. In this case the proper hardware. I had to buy a more ergonomic mouse after those 14-hour Figma marathons!</p>

    <p class="mb-2">If I were to keep improving the project, I’d focus on usability testing. I haven’t done much of it yet, and it’s hard to get meaningful feedback on something that isn’t a real product. But once I land a UX job, that’s one area I’m excited to grow in. I’d also add small touches like local storage or flavor filters just to push the realism further.</p>

    <p class="mb-2">Most importantly, this project proved to me that I’m not just learning UX. I <strong>am</strong> a UX designer. I finally see how all my experiences, all my instincts, and now all this structure are coming together. The imposter syndrome is still there, but it’s getting quieter. And I know that this is just the beginning.</p>
