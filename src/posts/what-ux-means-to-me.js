    <h2 class="blog-title">What UX Means to Me</h2>
    <p>I only learned the word <em>UX</em> about two years ago. At the time, I was teaching myself web design and kept seeing it pop up. I looked into it, but I figured I’d stay focused on design itself — that seemed like the path I’d take.</p>

    <p>But everything changed during my last job at the University of San Diego.</p>

    <p>I walked into a system that was completely disorganized. I was honestly shocked that such a prestigious university operated with so little structure — at least in our department. It threw me off. So I started fixing it.</p>

    <p>I built an organized project management system in Notion. I created a single source of truth for our department’s events. I reworked our entire marketing system with release timelines, narrative-driven fliers, and branding aligned with USD’s visual identity. I rebuilt our email newsletter from the ground up, with better UX, hierarchy, skimmability — and tied everything into tracking and analytics. What started as just “fixing stuff” turned into something much bigger.</p>

    <p>That’s when UX <em>clicked</em> for me. And it just so happened that I was also taking the Google UX Design course on Coursera at the same time. As I went deeper into UX thinking — empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test — I had a realization:</p>

    <p>This wasn’t just a design process. This was my <strong>life</strong>.</p>

    <p>I’ve failed a lot. I’d hit walls, take a step back, figure out what went wrong, try something new, and do it again. That is UX. That’s the mindset.</p>

    <p>Take this example: When I was living in Japan, I entered a speech contest. I was confident — even wore a suit. But the moment I got on stage, I froze. It was one of the hardest, most embarrassing moments of my life. But I didn’t quit. The next semester, I enrolled in a public speaking class. It turned out to be one of the most transformative experiences I’ve ever had. I was forced to speak in front of people <em>every single day</em>. Fast forward a few years, and I’m confidently teaching English to classrooms of 5 to 30 students. No nerves. No fear. That’s UX in real life.</p>

    <p>Honestly, I didn’t even graduate high school. I was lost back then — no drive, no discipline, no goals. If that version of me could see who I am today, I don’t think he’d believe it.</p>

    <p>But maybe he should. Because everything I’ve become — the way I live, the way I think, the way I grow — it all ties back to UX.</p>

    <p>That’s why I believe I’ll thrive in this field. UX just <em>makes sense</em> to me. It’s how I approach everything: with empathy, structure, intention, and the understanding that iteration is the only path to growth. I know it won’t be easy. But honestly, I’m looking forward to that. Because if it’s hard, it means I’m learning.</p>

    <p>And learning is what I’ve always done best — even when no one expected it from me.</p>
