# My Portfolio

**Live Site:** [MyPortfolio](https://juan-lagunas.com/)

This portfolio was built to showcase my work as a UX designer in a way that reflects my values: clarity, usability, and focus. It’s a simple, responsive site built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages. While it’s not packed with flashy features, it does what it needs to do. Which is highlighting real-world projects, communicating my process, and presenting it a vibrant distinct style that represents who I am as a designer.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Designed to look and function well on all devices and across a wide range of screen sizes.
- **Beautiful User Interface:** The site represents who I am as a designer, my skills, and how I like to work with visual design principles.
- **Built with Vue and Tailwind CSS:** I used Vue.js framework for dynamic and reactive components, and styled with Tailwind CSS for efficient and modular CSS design..
- **Modern Web Technologies:** Built with Vue, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS for a seamless and responsive user interface.
- **Modular Project Structure:** The project is highly modular, making it easy to maintain, update, and extend. Components are well-organized, promoting reusability and scalability.
- **Dark/Light Modes:** Intuitive navigation with a sidebar menu that allows users to easily switch between different planet pages.
- **Accessible:** The site follows best practices in web accessibility, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the content.
- **Semantic HTML:** I made sure to use semantic HTML elements to provide better structure and meaning to the web content, improving SEO and accessibility..
